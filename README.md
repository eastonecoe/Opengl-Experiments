Opengl Experiments
==================

Various bits of code I've written for my Computer Graphics class.

Mostly just me tinkering with various aspects of the OpenGL library.

All code was written in C++ using Visual Studios.

For Classmates: If you don't use my project, make sure to change your glut.h includes.
